# DecompViewer

This is a ROOT-based GUI which allows viewing of a GRETINA mode3/mode2 combined data set (in the form of ROOT file containing a TTree) which has been sorted using the LBNL GRETINA-unpack code (could be adapted to other ROOT TTree formats).

The primary use is as a diagnostic viewer for comparing waveforms and the results of signal decomposition.
